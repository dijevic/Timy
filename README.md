# Timy App

<h1 align="center"> Timy </h1>
<h3 color="red" align="center">A React app to handle your time :) </h3>

**This is a simple and short project where you will be able to use a pomodoro, a cronometer and a temporizer**

- At the moment , just the pomodoro is working but i will finish the other two modules as soon as posible . The project is now just a Front-end but i am planning extend it to a full stack app

- By the way, I will keep my tendency to name my apps with and 'Y' at the end of the named (time - timy)

<p margin="20px">For this short and simple project I worked with (<b>react-context API</b>) , React Router v6 (<b>Routing</b>) and love </p>
